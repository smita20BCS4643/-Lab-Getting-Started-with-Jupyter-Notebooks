# Overview of Code and Markdown Cells
A Jupyter notebook usually has many cells. A cell is an input field that allows you to enter multiple lines of text.

There are two types of cells in a Jupyter notebook:

* Markdown cell
* Code cell



<b1> 1. Markdown cell</b>:




<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
Use Markdown cells to include text that should not be read and executed as language-specific code. You can include rich-text code descriptions of your code by entering and formatting the text in a Markdown cell.<br/>

Markdown cells allow us to apply several formatting options with the Markdown language: 

* Headings
* Links
* Tables
* Paragraphs
* Bold text
* Lists
* And more

</div>

<b>Code cell</b>

Use Code cells when you want to write and modify code. The default cell displayed in a Jupyter notebook is a Code cell.
